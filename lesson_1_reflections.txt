1- 	
	Seeing differences line by line helps is helpfull when some code crashes and you want to compare it with a previous version to see what did you change and what may have been the cause of the failure

2- How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	By having a series of versions you also get a series of steps you took to accomplish the final result, so, if you want create a similar file (totally or partially implemented) you have a series of steps 
	chronologicaly ordered

3 - What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Pros: you can decide when its a good time to commit, saving functional blocks of code, and not imcomplete fuctions. 
	Cons: human error, you might forget to commit, commit too often or not commint enough

4- Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Maybe because Git is built for a coding eviroment where multiple files are connected, on the other hand, in google docs people usually works on a single file and it does not make sense to save multiple files as one commmit

5- How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	By checking 2 different commits I can view how the file has been updated

6 - How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	It could be really helpful when some code file runs with a bug and to find it I might have to go over a lot a code lines, instead this may help me get to the point where the bug was introduced and let me know which I change so I can checkout only the changes and not wat remains the same

7- Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I recently finished the android basics nanodegree and I was doing manual version control which is not very effective, so I want to use git to help me code android apps
