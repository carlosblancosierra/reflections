1- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Almost Every time, unless special circumstances, if it is online you can check it wherever you have an internet connection.

2- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you might pull something you don’t want to pull yet, like a change from another developer, or maybe you are testing something out and don’t want files to be updated, or maybe by pulling everything you might create un wanted conflicts

3- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

a clone is a copy of a repository, either local or remote
a fork is also a clone of a repository but maintains a link to the original one and its author
a branch is a series of commits that may or may not be the master one in a project

4- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Is useful because when fetching the remote state you don’t need to load every commit again
